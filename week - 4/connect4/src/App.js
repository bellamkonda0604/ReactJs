      <p>The standard game size for a Connect 4 game is a 6x7 grid consisting of 42 cells.</p>
      <p>Each player takes turns dropping a token into a column â€” which drops to the lowest available slot. 
        Once settled, the players check to see if their newly placed piece. 
        in combination with any existing pieces of their same color. 
        make a straight light of four tokens. 
        If four tokens are connected in a horizontal/vertical/diagonal line, that player wins.</p>
      <p>A valid connection must have four tokens that are immediately adjacent to each other,
